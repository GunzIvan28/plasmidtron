v0.1.1 - 31/01/17
------
Increase default min contig length to be about 4 times the average fragment size.
Reduce the default kmer size to 51.

v0.1.0 - 31/01/17
------
Rescaffold at the end by extracting kmers from spades assembly, reextracting reads, and reassembling & filtering.

v0.0.3 - 18/01/17
------
Cleanup SPAdes output files to reduce the amount of disk space used.
The final output is now the scaffolded assembly rather than the contigs.
Improve documentation.

v0.0.2 - 16/01/17
------
Allow for the trait kmers to be filtered differently. By default all kmers in the trait set only get used for filtering reads for assembly (union). This can be changed to strict so only kmers occuring in all trait samples are used (intersection).
Validate input values.
Allow for a max number of kmers filter.
